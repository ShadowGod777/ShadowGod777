# 👨‍💻 Manny Rodriguez (aka ShadowGod777)

Hey there — I’m Manny Rodriguez, a cybersecurity student currently working toward my **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at Southern New Hampshire University**. I’m still learning and growing every day, but I’ve already put in serious hands-on work through my home lab, personal projects, and self-guided experiments.

Most of what you’ll see here was built while I was still figuring things out — learning by doing, breaking things, fixing them, and improving a little each time.
